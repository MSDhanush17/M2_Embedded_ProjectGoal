# Passenger-controlled seat heater case-study

## Introduction
   
Now a days many countries are facing problem with cooling issue due to weather conditions because of that the vechicle seats are getting cold and making the passenger drive the vechile uncomfortably ,So inorder to resolve this issue we have coe up with an idea that is seat heater controlled by the passenger  .

In our project the main aim is to design and develop the system which is capable of monitoring the passanger's existance and Heat Monitoring
and Displaying.

## Challenges Faced and How i resolved them

1. Working with code blocks IDE is a callenge for me and i resolved it by learning from youtube
2. making circuit diagrams using simulid and i solved it by learning from future skills

## Learning Platforms
1. Youtube
2. future skills
3. geeks for geeks
